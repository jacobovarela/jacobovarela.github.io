        <h1>Jacobo Varela 👨&zwj;💻</h1>
        <p><small>"It's my website and I'll write what I want to."</small></p>
        <p>In late 2020 I came across <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25135752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a> on HackerNews about building a website from scratch, with very basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. So I got inspired and decided I wanted to create my own portfolio website.</p>
        <p>This is something that I've been planning to do since I finished my <a href="https://medium.com/carbon-engineering/how-i-became-a-data-scientist-ca8a8148a010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Science bootcamp</a> back in 2018, but every time I got sidetracked because "you already have your CV and projects on LinkedIn, why would you spend time or money on this".</p>
        <p>I now look at it as an opportunity to learn something new, this "project" forces me to dive into web development, code in a new language (javascript) and maybe explore a new framework (vue.js ?).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First thing I did was to buy the domain name through Namecheap.</li>
            <li>I decided to use GitHub pages to host the website, I already know how to use the platform and it's easy to set up the custom domain name.</li>
            <li>I soon learnt that the browser can't run Python, so in future iterations I am planning to use Netlify to host the website.</li>

            <li>...</li>

        </ul>

        <div class="my-things">
        <p>Here is a list of concepts and mental models that help me think better and make intelligent decisions:</p>
        <p><strong>It's a numbers game 💯</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">Whatever you're working on, it's probably a numbers game.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">This means the success and results depend on KPIs that are measurable.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">The way to move the needle is changing numbers around, whether its hours of work or money spent.</p>
        <p><strong>Pareto Principle 📈</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">Roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes.</p>
        <p><strong>Regret minimization framework 😖</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">Project yourself into the future and look back on your decision from that perspective.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">This concept ties in nicely with <strong>Problem Inversion:</strong> the practice of thinking through problems in reverse.</p>
        <p><strong>Forced serendipity ☘️</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">The harder I work, the luckier I seem to get.</p>
        <p><strong>Principal-Agent Problem 👑</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">A conflict in priorities between the owner of an asset and the person to whom control of the asset has been delegated.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">📖 Skin in the Game by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.</p>
        <p><strong>Second-Order Thinking 🙋‍♂️</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">Always ask “And then what?”</p>
        <p><strong>Opportunity Cost ⚖️</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">The loss of value/benefit from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen.</p>
        <p><strong>Barbell strategy 🏋️‍♂️</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">To strike a balance between reward and risk you should invest in the two extremes of high-risk and no-risk assets while avoiding middle-of-the-road choices.</p>
        <p><strong>To Care and Communicate 📢</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">Success often comes from caring about what you do, and making an effort to communicate it.</p>
        <p><strong>Network Effects 🕸</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">Increased numbers of people or participants improve the value of a good or service.</p>
        <p><strong>NP vs P ⏱</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">If the solution to a problem is easy to check for correctness, must the problem be easy to solve? (For example, cracking a password).</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">The general class of questions for which some algorithm can provide an answer in polynomial time is "P". For some questions, there is no known way to find an answer quickly, but if one is provided with information showing what the answer is, it is possible to verify the answer quickly. The class of questions for which an answer can be verified in polynomial time is NP, which stands for "nondeterministic polynomial time”.</p>
        <p><strong>Cognitive Biases 🧠</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">Systematic errors in thinking. The individual construction of reality generally dictates human behaviour.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong>Groupthink 🐑:</strong> people strive for consensus within a group, resulting in a dysfunctional / irrational decision-making outcome.</p>
        <p><strong>Logical Fallacies 🤔</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">Deductive arguments that are invalid / reasoning that is logically incorrect.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong>Strawman 💀:</strong> you misrepresented someone's argument to make it easier to attack.</p>
